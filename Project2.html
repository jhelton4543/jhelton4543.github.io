<h2>What is competitive Pokémon?</h2>
  <p>  Competitive Pokémon is where you would strategize in picking a team of six that you can use efficiently and effectively when battling other people via locally or online. Competitive Pokémon is formatted in double battles which is you would have two of your Pokémon fighting against two of your opponent's Pokémon. With doubles battles you can only choose four out of the six in your team.  <br>
    <br>
      When building your team there are many different things you need to look at when building it those would include
    
     
 
  <ol type= a>
     <li>Pokémon</li>
     <li>Pokémon's ability</li>
     <Li>Held Item</Li>
     <li>Pokémon's Tera Type</li>
     <li>The 4 moves for the Pokémon</li>
     </ol>
   There is more when looking for but that can get very complicated. <br>
  <br>
  If you don't know what a ability is a Pokémon's special thing it has that can help out its self or help out its teamate Pokémon that it is fighting with.
